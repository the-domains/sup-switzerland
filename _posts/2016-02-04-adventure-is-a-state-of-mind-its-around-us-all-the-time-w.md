ADVENTURE IS A STATE OF MIND. IT'S AROUND US ALL THE TIME, WE JUST NEED TO LOOK. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/800ce6b0-644c-41ad-8a39-5e325ebbb5c5.JPG)

Adventure can be found in things we do and places we go every day. It's about getting into the wild, enjoying the outdoors and being re-invigorated by nature, experience and most of all, it's about having fun. We love grabbing our Origin inflatable paddle boards SUP and going on a little adventure (often with our kids in tow). When we're not in the office and we get chance, you'll most likely find us camping near a lake or river, using our boards as sleeping mats! \#GoExplore.   
IF YOU FANCY A BIGGER (BUT STILL ACHIEVABLE) ADVENTURE, THEN TAKE A LOOK AT PROJECT ORIGIN AND GET \#INSPIRED. WE'RE ALL ABOUT PEOPLE GETTING OUTDOORS AND ENJOYING THE WATER ON AN ORIGIN INFLATABLE PADDLE BOARD.
