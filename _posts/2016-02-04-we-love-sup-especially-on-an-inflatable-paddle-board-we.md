WE LOVE SUP (ESPECIALLY ON AN INFLATABLE PADDLE BOARD). WE THINK IT'S THE PERFECT WAY TO GET OUTDOORS, ENJOY THE WATER, HAVE AN ADVENTURE, EXERCISE, RELAX, OR EVEN HAVE A BOARD MEETING; THAT'S WHERE WE HOLD OURS!   
And because our boards are the lightest, most rigid inflatable paddle boards in the world, they love to be thrown in the boot of your car, strapped on the back of your bike, taken on the bus, coach, train or plane, then hit the water at the other end.   
THEY TRULY ARE \#DESIGNEDTOTRAVEL.   
Hike a trail with it on your back to a hidden lake, stroll across the dunes to a beach, float down a local river or take a gondola into the mountains and paddle at altitude. \#GoExplore
